# ECE306
Introduction to designing microcontroller-based embedded computer systems using assembly and C programs to control input/output peripherals. Use of embedded operating system.  In this class at NC State I constructed an RC car and used this code to initialize ports, calibrate sensors, and feed instructions to an MSP40 board to traverse an obstacle course.
